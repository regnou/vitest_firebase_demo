# DEMO with Firebase/FIRESTORE and VITEST

The purpose of this demo, is to run some unit tests, with Firestore and Vitest.
Actually, I am looking for some help to have the tests working...

To run the tests:
`npm run test`

To run the firebase emulator:
`npm run emu`

TODO: You MAY have yo create some file to setup the project:
I have put 2 commits named: PUT_YOUR_CREDENTIAL_HERE
1. .firebaserc
2. rename: .env-TODO -> .env
